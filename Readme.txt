Since IFMS does not have a way to allow an user to automatically update assets, I created this script that will do it for you.
As a custodian, when you have lots of assets to update, it is a painstaking task to have to manually update each asset.
This script will take input in from the CSV files you provide. Then, by using pyautogui, look for and automatically click the correct fields to update them.

Currently, this script only supports updating an assets sort field and location. ALthough, this should be enough for what we currently need to do.
If you require more functionality, please email me at akpai@edu.uwaterloo.ca
